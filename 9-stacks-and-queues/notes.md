stacks and queues have no random access property!

stacks are last in first out (lifo) think about the stack in magic, how things resolve off
of the top. or a stack of plates - you need to take the first off the top.

queues are first in first out (fifo) think about a line (or queue in british english) for a
roller coaster. first to enter the line, first to leave the line
