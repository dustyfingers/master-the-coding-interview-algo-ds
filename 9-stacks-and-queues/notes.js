// stack is like navigation history in our browser

// queue is like a line to get into a concert

// stacks can be implemented with either arrays or linked lists...

// ...but queues are a bad match for arrays wholesale. beacuse we are
// always removing the head and unshifting all of the items in array based implementations
// which is bad for performance
