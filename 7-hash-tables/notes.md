almost every language has a built in hash table

hash tables are a collection of key-value pairs

a hash function maps each key to a value stored in memory

hash functions are one way - no way to determine input from given output
hash functions always return the same thing given a certain input

given a certain key, the hash function always points to a certain value stored at an address in memory
