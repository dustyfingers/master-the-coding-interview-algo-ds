a linked list is a list of connected nodes

each node contains a value, and a pointer to the next value

linked lists are 'null terminated' - the last item in the list points to null

when are linked lists better than hashtables or arrays?
faster insertion than an array - rather than recalculating every index, we just need to reassign a few pointers
